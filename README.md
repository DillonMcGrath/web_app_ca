the origonal section that filled out here was deletd by mistake so i have created my own one to write the passage about this webapp assignment to meet the needs of the assignment breif. as i found this writing section of the breif to be a bit misleading i have wrote both a description of the website but also a breakdown on how i made it and the use of AI that was used 

this web app is for an auto repair and upgrade company who offers acsess and information bsed on the cars they have had in with them fro repair or fixing a review section where people can leave reviews on the mechanic and the efficency of there work there is also a bookings section where people can input there details for so they can be contacted to get there slot 

throug out this app makeing process i found that the website did look quite bleak which lead to me spending hours using css to achive a look that i am happy with though i do enjoy the css section of styling and makeing the app look well it was very time consuming and i found myself quite stuck for time on finnishing some of the main componnts of this assignments witch ifi were to be doing it again i would be 100% consider the use of AI as it would be able to develope and creat a similar look in a fraction of thetime 

in speaking of the ai i did infact use it (refrenced where it was used in the sourse code of the page) to help me complete certain collections on this app as through my own attempts i was unable to incorpreate it correctly so the use of Ai helped me to both fix and understand the code that was being implemnted the prompts such as "can you explain as to why this code is giving errors" and "i dont 100% understand what this means "proved to be quite helpful and informative and i found that it helped me have an good understnding which then lead to me being able to implement other collections by myself as the extra explaination i had recived gave me insight to mistakes i was makeing and caused me to correct them
